# Simple-Weather-API-
# ABOUT:-
Your Python code retrieves current weather information for a given city using the WeatherAPI. After taking user input for the city name, it sends an API request, parses the JSON response, and extracts the current temperature in Celsius. It then uses the `win32com` library to convert this information into speech, announcing the current weather to the user. Note that you need to have the `requests` and `win32com.client` libraries installed for this code to work properly.
